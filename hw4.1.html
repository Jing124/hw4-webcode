    <p id="html">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a markup language. It includes a variety of tags.
        Through
        these tags, the document format on the network can be unified, and the scattered Internet resources can be
        connected as a logical whole. HTML text is descriptive text composed of HTML commands. HTML commands can
        describe text, graphics, animation, sounds, tables, links, etc.

    <p id="css">Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
        and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
        relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well
        as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
        its formatting.
